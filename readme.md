[DBtune](www.dbune.com) is an automated service that helps DBAs and DevOps engineers to perform parameter tuning of PostgreSQL (PG) instances. 
If you have several instances to optimize DBtune facilitates a tedious task that takes time and effort so that DBAs and DevOps engineers can focus on other pressing matters instead.
By running optimized PG instances users end up needing fewer computing resources, saving a ton of cloud credits and CO2.

This wiki is an hands-on training which offers the opportunity to try the [DBtune platform](app.dbune.com) to tune a PG instance. 
You will be offered to tune a synthetic workload instance that this provides and that you will set up on the fly following the wiki.

To get started with this hands-on follow the steps in the [wiki](https://github.com/dbtuneai/synthetic_workload/wiki).
